OpenOT is an ortholinear keyboard with a trackball integrated to the right side (design could be mirrored for left handed users, etc.)

The trackball mount used is called OpenMount and can be used for other trackball designs as well.

The OpenMount uses 10mmx4mmx5mm roller bearings, I found the larger size to impact smoothness and longevity in a positive way.

The encoder wheel is a unique orientation that is embedded into the case and traackball and requires a bit of technical knowhow to get it right.

The encoder wheel also needs a "center axle" that goes through and also connects inside the encoder wheel; personally I have been using 1.5mm steel baling 
wire that I cut and straighten to the right length, and then flattening out one end so that it "keys" into the encoder.

All the components I printed out on an ender 3, although I want to find a place that can print the case out in one piece because it is require to print it in two pieces on the ender 3
