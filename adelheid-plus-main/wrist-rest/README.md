Below are tables that represent the screw/standoff positions.  The top row are the upper positions, while the bottom row are the lower positions.  Left column are the left-most positions, while the right column are the right-most positions. The lenghts are based on the assumption that your acrylic layers are all around 2.8mm thick. Tip: secure the top 4mm screws into the standoffs first before starting on the bottom ones.
